	"aboutme": "About Me: \n\nJames Harper \n Computer Science Major at the University of Cincinnati \n E-mail: harper_j96@outlook.com \n Interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Demonstration Learning, Web Development, React \n\nProfessional Introduction\nI have experience with analyzing and creating data structures. Through my work with Siemen Software's Advanced Solutions team, I have studied knowledge graphs and semantic databases. I have also used Tensorflow to create deep learning neural networks for use with image recognition and worked on systems used for data labelling. I analyzed and implemented new approaches to machine learning, such as Deep Q-Learning from Demonstration. I have studied Database Theory and Information Retrieval topics, allowing me to create and navigate my own data structures from scratch. My experience working with a research team has also helped me understand how to deal with shifting priorities.\n\n When it comes to general development, my previous experience working with legacy code is my greatest strength. I hyper-focus on environment I am introduced to until it becomes my own, which was helpful during my work at my previous company, having been moved around 3 different teams in the space of two years. \n\nI want to expand upon my previous experiences with machine learning, database creation, and navigation."
